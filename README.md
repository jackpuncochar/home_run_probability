# home_run_probability
Thesis for my master's degree in data science. I used logistic regression to predict the pre-pitch probability of hitting a home run. Model features included stats that identified hitter and pitcher skill. Game state data such as count, outs, and ballpark dimensions were included. The probability was displayed as a scoreboard using an R Shiny app.
